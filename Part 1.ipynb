If you want to go deeper, be sure to check out the \"help\" menu, which has a link to this [Notebook Help](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/3.x/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb) and a lot more. You can also check out the [Official Jupyter Documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\n",

If there is more than one possible completion, it will give you a menu. It can even complete package names in import statements. It can't totally read your mind, so in some cases you will need to run some code before it's ready to do all the completions, but you'll get the gist of it.\n",
    "* Use _shift-tab_ for help. If you type it at the end of a function, or after the opening parentheses, it will show you the documentation for the function. If you use _shift-tab_ three times in sequence, it opens the documentation in a separate pane.\n"
